This program encrypts and decrypts an input file using symmetric encryption.

The encrypted file is placed into an output file. The user will be prompted
on whether or not they would like to decrypt the output file. Next the user
will be prompted on whether or not they would like to run the program again.

NOTES:
Do not include '.txt' in name of input or output file.
For example, title input text 'Input' not 'Input.txt'
